# Printrbot Simple Metal 3D Printer Project

Welcome to the repository for the **Printrbot Simple Metal 3D Printer Project**! This project is dedicated to documenting my journey with the Printrbot Simple Metal 3D printer from 2014. This printer has played a crucial role in my learning of engineering principles and honing my design skills. In this README, you'll find information about my initial experiences, the assembly process, upgrades, and some of my favorite accessories for this printer.

## Background

3D printing is a hobby that I've been exploring for a while. Inspired by YouTube channels like 3D Printing Nerd and Barnacules, my curiosity grew, and I began considering buying a 3D printer to expand my project horizons and delve into 3D design. The decision of whether to buy a pre-built printer or a kit posed a challenge. I have a knack for building things, having disassembled and reassembled gadgets since childhood. However, the intricacies of 3D printers made me wonder if assembling a kit would be overwhelming. Despite my concerns, the idea of building a kit intrigued me, knowing that it would provide me with an in-depth understanding of the machine.

### Choosing the Printrbot Simple Metal

After thorough research, I set my sights on the Printrbot Simple Metal. This printer struck a balance between being available as both a kit and a fully assembled printer. Its reasonable price and clear assembly instructions made it stand out. Equally important, Printrbot boasted a strong and supportive community, a factor that resonated with me. Knowing I could rely on the community for guidance added to my confidence in this choice.

### Assembly and Calibration

Upon finally acquiring the Printrbot Simple Metal Kit with Heated Bed, I embarked on the assembly journey. The kit provided a decent challenge, though the assembly instructions were well-structured and comprehensive. The true challenge surfaced during my first print and subsequent calibrations. The printer employs an auto-leveling probe that detects metal. Achieving the perfect nozzle calibration took several days of meticulous adjustments. Additional calibrations, like fine-tuning retraction speeds and increasing print speeds, followed.

## Favorite Accessories and Upgrades

As my experience with the Printrbot Simple Metal grew, I discovered several essential accessories and upgrades that significantly improved its performance:

1. **FINGER FLOBBER**: An ingenious solution for filament changes, enhancing the extruder's cooling capabilities. [Thingiverse Link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:446480)

2. **Printrbot Fan Duct**: This fan duct ensures optimal cooling around the extruder, especially for fine prints. [Thingiverse Link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:356001)

3. **Chain Link**: While not critical, this add-on prevents wire harness strain on the heated bed. [Thingiverse Link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1060522)

4. **Pi Camera Case**: A custom case to mount the camera on the bed, improving visibility during prints. [Thingiverse Link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:673133)

5. **Ubis 13s Hotend**: I replaced the old hotend with an all-metal Ubis 13s, enabling me to print a wider range of materials. Cooling was enhanced with an additional fan.

6. **Z-Axis Lead Screw**: Replaced the old acme screw with a metric lead screw for smoother movement and easier calibration.

7. **Blower Fan Upgrade**: I opted for a blower fan, providing better cooling efficiency. An adapter allowed easy installation.

## Final Form and Upgrades

This printer has severed me very well over the years, and since then I've built new printers. In it'f final form, I have updated the mainboard to a BigTreeTech SKR MINI V2 that has a 32-bit chip as well as better stepper drivers. This also meant, uploading new Marling firmware, which can be found here:

Addtionally, I added a TFT display to easily upload prints and a slim PSU.
